# Session State

**Purpose**: Compact status snapshot. Detailed history lives in commit log + scratchpad archive.
**Update**: At checkpoints — task start, blocker, end-of-session.

**Status**: **Phase D IN-DEV-COMPLETE-PENDING-MERGE 2026-05-12** — Plan B + B2 ratified by Sir this turn. Phase D dispatcher/registry event-driven refactor shipped local on Alfred-Dev nate-dev (D.4 pulse events endpoint + D.5+Plan-B-revision risk:*-only score.py + D.7 event-watcher.sh polling block + D.8 registry.yaml 3-pipeline-job disable; D.6 SKIPPED per Plan B). D.9 in-dev smoke green: 12 task.created events processed, all received risk:* (zero auto:* anywhere), URL-encoded cursor functions, v2 orchestrate.py demonstrably operational on test task decomposition. Held local (per B2) until PR #3 merges, then ships as separate PR. Prior: **PR OPENED 2026-05-12 as [davidmoneil/AIFred-Pro#3](https://github.com/davidmoneil/AIFred-Pro/pull/3)** — A1 scope chosen (110-commit batch, all of nate-dev since 2026-04-22; first batch-merge since branch creation). M3 SHIPPED 2026-05-11 (`fcf62df`). F-1 in-vivo confirmed 2026-05-12 post-SIGCONT: pipeline approval gate did zero work; F-5 surfaced (executor silent blocked:no→yes mutation). F-1/F-5 content lives in canonical Jarvis docs. PR #3 pending David's review/merge.
**Date**: 2026-05-12 (Phase D in-dev-complete session — Plan B + B2 ratified + 3 file edits + smoke + doc updates)
**Version**: v5.11.0
**Branch (Jarvis)**: Project_Aion → origin/main on CannonCoPilot/Jarvis (synced)
**Last commit (Jarvis)**: c413e03 (docs(workstreams): Phase D dispatcher/registry audit + architectural rule codified). Pending this turn: Phase D D.10 doc updates (audit §5/§6/§9 + workstream-arch §6.2 + scratchpad + session-state).
**Last commit (Alfred-Dev)**: 18c1136 PUSHED + eb6032f local (D.5 initial) + 78693a3 local (D.4). UNCOMMITTED local this turn (3 files): score.py Plan-B revision (-49 LOC), event-watcher.sh (+51 LOC D.7 polling block), registry.yaml (3 pipeline jobs disabled + Plan-B comment block).

## Pulse / Nexus boundary tagging (2026-05-05)
Per `Jarvis/projects/project-aion/reports/pulse-nexus-boundary-audit-2026-05-05.md`:
- **Pulse** = state-of-record service (FastAPI + Postgres on :8700/:8800; tasks, labels, transitions, events, triggers, observability tables)
- **Nexus** = orchestration platform (dispatcher, executor, pipeline-v2 services, personas, dashboard, communication)
- New workstream descriptions use `[Pulse]` / `[Nexus]` / `[Boundary]` / `[Boundary-violation]` prefixes

## Current Priorities

### P0 (COMPLETE 2026-05-04): Context-Budget Optimization + Nexus-Sync Supplant
- **Context-Budget**: Stages 1-3 force-loaded reductions (97K→15K, -84%) + Stage 4 cull (21 skills + 6 agents + 4 MCPs disabled)
- **Nexus-Sync Supplant**: 25 commits onto nate-dev (21 David + 4 ours):
  - R4: baseline tag pushed (`pre-supplant-baseline-2026-05-04` @ e8ccf64)
  - R5.1-R5.4: all 21 David commits cherry-picked (with line-by-line conflict resolution per R3-Q1)
  - 2 our-authorship in-flight fixes: jobsdb→nexusdb completion (181a742), PROJECT_DIR tautology repair (78f5b49)
  - R5.5: NEW `services/observability/` python package (audit/decision/cost loggers + thread_id) + wired into 6 pipeline-v2 services (1983dc0)
  - R6: `pulse/migrations/0001-phase-5-1-observability-tables.sql` applied to pulse_dev; dual-write payloads validated against schema (bb2d453)
  - R7: fast-forward + push to davidmoneil/AIFred-Pro nate-dev complete
- Debrief: `Shared_Projects/Debriefs/AIFred-Pro/2026-05-04-nexus-sync-supplant-completion.md`
- Validation: `Jarvis/projects/project-aion/reports/nexus-sync-supplant-r{1,2,6}-*.md`

### P1 (COMPLETE 2026-05-04): AIFred-Pro Dev — A1 + B1-rich Dashboard
- A1 [Nexus]: /personas page wired up (stale container recreate + parseValue inline-comment fix). 32 personas surfaced cleanly. Commit f052778. Note: dashboard reads Nexus persona YAMLs from disk — boundary leak (F-2 in audit), deferred.
- B1-rich [Boundary-violation]: DecisionsPage with cross-table storyline view. First direct PostgreSQL in dashboard. 5 new endpoints + 440 LOC frontend page. Commit 042247b (+1206 LOC). Direct pg.Pool access bypasses Pulse's API — addressed by P1.B1.1 (Pulse READ API).
- **Adapt-absorb-replace finding (per user directive)**: executor.py had ~30% observability parity vs executor.sh. 8/33 sites ported; missing all 10 inline operational decisions + _parse_and_emit_persona_decisions hook. Surfaced as P1.6 workstream — now COMPLETE.
- Real-flow evidence: executor.sh --job ollama-test → 5 rows in pulse_dev ($0.00 via qwen3:8b local).
- Report: `projects/project-aion/reports/p1-dashboard-personas-decisions-2026-05-04.md`

### P1.5 [Pulse] (COMPLETE 2026-05-04 evening): Pulse API endpoints — observability dual-write LIVE
- pulse/app.py: parse_iso_ts() helper + 3 POST endpoints (+122 LOC)
- aifred-pulse:latest rebuilt; aifred-dev-pulse recreated --no-deps
- End-to-end validated: python log_audit() → pulse_dev row via API path → main spool → 0-byte swallowed-errors (no fail-quiet)
- Commit Alfred-Dev `090f6ec` on nate-dev
- Report: `projects/project-aion/reports/p15-pulse-observability-endpoints-2026-05-04.md`
- Followup [Boundary]: P1.B1.1 — add symmetric Pulse READ endpoints (GET /audit/events, /audit/decisions, /costs/events, /observability/storyline/{thread_id}, /observability/stats) so dashboard can drop direct-DB access. ~3-4 hr.

### P1.6 [Nexus] (COMPLETE 2026-05-05): Executor.py + pipeline-watcher.py observability port
- P1.6 (5720cdc): executor.py 7 → 30 observability sites (+376/-7 LOC)
- P1.6.x (4322469): pipeline-watcher.py retry/give_up decisions + job.retrying audit (+75 LOC)
- P1.6.y (6305258): fail_fast auth circuit breaker (executor + pipeline-watcher + state file, +119 LOC)
- M1 hygiene (002f02e): lib/pulse-env.sh canonical PULSE_API_URL resolver + 4 unconditional-hardcode fixes (+34/-20 LOC)
- Live restart still needed for pipeline-watcher PID 94229 (running pre-P1.6 code since Thursday)
- Reports: `projects/project-aion/reports/p1-dashboard-personas-decisions-2026-05-04.md`, `pulse-nexus-boundary-audit-2026-05-05.md`

### P1.B1.1 [Boundary] (NEW 2026-05-05, surfaced by audit): Pulse observability READ API
- Add 5 GET endpoints to pulse/app.py to symmetrize the P1.5 write API
- Refactor dashboard/server/services/pulse-events.ts to consume Pulse API; drop pg dependency
- ~3-4 hr. Repairs the P1.B1 boundary violation.

### P2 [Nexus]: Jarvis — C1 Phase 4 intelligent scheduling
- Pure-Jarvis usage-proxy work (budget gates, priority queue, Telegram)
- 2-3 sessions

### P3 [Nexus]: AIFred-Pro Dev — B2+B3 exploratory sweep
- B2: audit-ingest env adaptation + sidecar container for cron
- B3: David's `40290c4` orchestration graph viz already lifted; build out dashboard layer
- ~2-3 hr each

### Suspended: Chronicler Phase 4 — Narrative Engine
- Phase 3 COMPLETE 2026-03-23 (27/27 DoD)
- Paused pending P1 completion

## Live processes
- W1 Watcher: PID 5322 (with C1 fix), alive since 15:21:21
- W7 HUD: PID 32998 (with refresh_tokens_from_jsonl)

## Active gates
See `.active-plan` `gates:` block for full schedule. Key fires:

## Notes
- MCPs configured: 3 active (jarvis-rag, jarvis-graphiti, jarvis-pulse) + 4 disabled in `.mcp.json.disabled-2026-05-04` backup. Current session still has 7 loaded (MCP changes apply on next restart).
- JICM threshold: soft 250K, hard 300K (state-hook v7.9)
- Pulse API prod: `localhost:8700`; dev: `localhost:8800`
- Dev DB: `pulse_dev` / pw in `.claude/secrets/credentials.yaml`
