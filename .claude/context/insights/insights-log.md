**RTK and git --amend**: The RTK hook intercepts `git commit` and doesn't support `--amend`. When you need git operations that RTK can't handle, bypass it by calling `/opt/homebrew/bin/git` directly. This is a stable workaround — RTK is a token-saving proxy, not a full git replacement.

**GH007 email gotcha**: Even after setting `git config user.email`, the *current shell environment* may not pick it up for new commits. Always pass `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` as an env var on the commit line itself, not just in git config.
