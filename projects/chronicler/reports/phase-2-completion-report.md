# Phase 2: Explorer Core — Completion Report

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Phase**: 2 of 7 (Explorer Core)
**Milestone**: M2 — Explorer Complete
**Status**: DEFERRED — 30/30 DoD items implemented, pending User itemized review

### Post-Implementation Fixes
- **Race categorization priority fix** (2026-02-28): Forgotten beasts, titans, and demons were miscategorized as "Demigod" because DF marks them as `is_deity=TRUE`. Fixed by prioritizing creature-type flags (`has_any_feature_beast`, `has_any_titan`, `has_any_unique_demon`, `has_any_night_creature`) over `is_deity` in both the race-summary endpoint and the browse filter SQL. Now correctly shows: Forgotten Beast (867), Titan (33), Demon (9), Night Creature (394), Demigod (315), Gods (46).
- **Race pill UI + "Other" category** (2026-02-28): Replaced hardcoded checkbox filters with dynamic race pills rendered from `race-summary` API. 13 categories with counts auto-populate from creature_dictionary flags. Added biological variants tile that updates on race selection. The `_other` catch-all pill uses exclusion-based filtering (not entity races, not deities, not beasts/titans/demons/night creatures, not animated dead, not animal people) and has dimmer styling (55% opacity, dashed border) to visually distinguish it as a catch-all.

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 transforms Chronicler from a data ingestion tool into a full-featured world browser. Starting from Phase 1's 6-tab data grid, the Explorer Core adds **17 entity detail pages**, **global search with live autocomplete**, **perspective-aware event rendering**, **hover popovers**, and **complete cross-linking** across all entity types. The world "Tar Thran" (250 years, 436,455 events, 48,273 historical figures) is fully browsable.

| **DFCalendar** | `chronicler/explorer/calendar.py` | DF 12-month calendar with months, seasons, ordinals, tick conversion |
| **Popover system** | `detail_base.html` + `/api/popover/` | Tippy.js initialization, AJAX loading, per-type rendering, XSS-safe HTML |

### API Endpoints Added

|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/search` | GET | Global entity search (accent-insensitive) |

| `/api/explorer/export/query` | POST | Custom SQL export (CSV/JSON) |
| `/api/people/race-summary` | GET | Race categories with counts (13 categories) |
| `/api/people/variants-summary` | GET | Biological variant breakdown for selected race |

## Test Results

### Automated Tests (218 collected)
- **192 passed** — Core functionality (parser, schema, ingestion, CLI, API routes)
- **11 failed** — All in live-data integration tests (DFHack units, bridge sections) — Phase 5 scope
- **5 errors** — Separate validation harness requiring DB setup
- **9 skipped** — Conditional tests (not applicable to current dataset)
- **1 xfailed** — Expected failure (known gap)

### Manual Endpoint Testing (30/30 DoD items)

Every DoD item was tested via HTTP requests against the running server:
- All 17 entity detail pages return HTTP 200 with substantial content (4.5KB–30KB)
- Search returns properly ranked results with type badges and snippets
- Popovers return rich HTML with entity-type-specific fields
- Cross-links verified: 50+ links on HF pages spanning 5+ entity types
- Perspective rendering confirmed: 21 `<em>` markers on HF event lists
- Calendar formatting: "Year N" throughout, "the Nth of Month, Year N" for dated events

### Performance

- Entity detail pages load in <100ms (server-side)
- Search autocomplete: 200ms debounce + fast ILIKE with unaccent
- Name cache: 5-minute TTL, batch loading by entity type (1 query per type, not per entity)

## Standalone Execution

```bash
# From the DwarfCron project directory:
cd /Users/nathanielcannon/Claude/Projects/DwarfCron
.venv/bin/chronicler serve --port 8000

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/explorer
```

No special handling required. The server starts, connects to PostgreSQL, and serves all pages.

## Next Phase
